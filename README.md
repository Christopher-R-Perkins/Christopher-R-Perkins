### Hey all, Christopher here ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-stack software engineer with a couple years in the tech industry. I like solving problems and software gives me a vehicle to do so.

Recently, I developed [Reverb](https://github.com/reverb-app), an open-source, event-driven, asynchronous workflow engine that abstracts away the logic and infrastructure developers need to orchestrate complex background tasks. Please check out the [case study](https://reverb-app.github.io) if you are interested in learning more.
